    "The Active filtering plugin provides a way to filter connection targets when a drag begins.",
    "When an activeFiltering plugin is set on a Surface and a beforeConnect function is supplied to the Toolkit's constructor, that function is called before a new connection is dragged, for every possible target for the current source.",
    "Whenever the beforeConnect method returns false, the corresponding target object (a Node, Group or Port) is disabled, and the user will not be able to drop the connection onto it.",
    "Each Node contains a set of entries which each contain the name of two types of animal. Entries are deemed connectable if one or more animals from the source entry are matched in a given target."
