    "Edges are directed in this demonstration - the arrow shows the direction.",
    "Edges cannot be traversed in the opposite direction to the way the arrow points",
    "Click a node to select it. Then click another node. The shortest path between the two nodes will be traversed with an overlay. If no path exists, an alert will show.",
